# Data required to run this analysis

This study is based on the eICU database. We do not and cannot provide the eICU data in this repository. You can gain permission to access the data from https://eicu-crd.mit.edu/ after completion of the requirements. Once the data is obtained, the first Jupyter notebook takes the reader through the process of data extraction and processing while the second notebook showcases the statistical analysis and visualization.
